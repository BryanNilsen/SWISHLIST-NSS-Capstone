***swishlist*** is an app developed for basketball players to log and track their shooting progress during workouts. Designed for mobile devices, this app provides the user a tool where they can record the total shots attempted and made from various locations with the aid of an interactive basketball court map. The user can then review their workouts to help identify and target areas of the court where they need to focus on improving their shooting percentage.

### Additional features of the app include:
* Player profile page with personal details and shooting statistics
* Leaderboard of top players in various categories
* Motivational quotes to reinforce work ethic and determination

I used Adobe XD from the very beginning of development to design the UI/UX aspect of this app. This tool allows developers to quickly build a prototype and provides a blueprint when building the app.

I used the Moment.js and npm react-moment tools for formatting dates in this app. These tools allow the user to parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.

To use Moment.js and react-moment in your React app, use the following npm command in your terminal:
> `npm install --save moment react-moment`
